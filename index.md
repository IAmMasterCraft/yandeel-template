This documentation is still a W-I-P


### To-do

Still have some couple of i's to dot and t's to cross:

```markdown
Identified pendings...

1. OTP input on verify page needs to be redesigned
2. Circular Progress on trade card page needs technical border-color
3. Quick action Button on settings page needs bg colors and active state shadows, backdrop filters etc...
4. Quick action Button on wallet withdrawal page needs text colors
5. Quick Filter Buttons color, borders, active state etc.. needs fixing
6. Border radius on table header on wallet and transactions table

```

<!-- ### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/IAmMasterCraft/yandeel-template/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
